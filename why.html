        <h2>Why I Prefer Cats Over Dogs</h2>
        <article>
            <p>For starters, Cats have better personalities than dogs- they're more laid back and reserved. However, to balance out their mysterious side, cats also have some fiestiness to them, which never fails to dissapoint. Cats are funny, adorable little creatures that are so much better at cuddling. Just picture lying in bed at night with your cute cat right beside you comforting you. Dogs can be too noisy or move too much to do the same, and the size and fluff on cats feels much better. And though cats make noise, it's not as much and as loud as dogs, and instead really cute when they meow.</p>
